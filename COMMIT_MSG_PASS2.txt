Problem: Code uses unsafe indexing and imperative patterns

Solution:

 - Add category-theoretic abstractions for safer, declarative code:
   - Comonadic ListZipper for focused navigation (src/Demo/Core/Zipper.hs)
   - Free monad UIAction DSL separating description from interpretation (src/Demo/Core/FreeUI.hs)
   - Contravariant handlers for type-safe event consumption (src/Demo/Core/Handlers.hs)
   - Kleisli arrows for streaming command execution (src/Demo/Core/FreeUI.hs)
 - Replace all !! indexing with safe ix optics:
   - Slides.hs uses (^? ix n) for Maybe-returning safe access
   - Notes.hs and Elaboration.hs similarly refactored
 - Add proper lens/prism infrastructure with Template Haskell:
   - makeLenses for all Types (src/Demo/Core/Types.hs)
   - makePrisms for Command sum type
 - Enable Data/Typeable deriving for Uniplate traversals
 - All 49 tests pass
