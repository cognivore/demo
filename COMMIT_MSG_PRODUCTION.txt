Problem: Demo framework cannot be used from arbitrary directories

Solution:

 - Add home-manager module for system-wide installation:
   - hintEnv: GHC with all packages needed by hint interpreter (flake.nix)
   - demo package: the four executables (flake.nix)
   - homeManagerModules.default for easy integration (flake.nix)

 - Implement path-independent presentation loading:
   - Detect project root by searching for .cabal/.git markers (src/Demo/Loader.hs)
   - Resolve elaboration paths relative to project root (src/Demo/UI/Elaboration.hs)
   - Store project context in LoadedPresentation type (src/Demo/Loader.hs)

 - Configure hint to find packages via ghc-pkg:
   - Use unsafeRunInterpreterWithArgs with package-db path (src/Demo/Loader.hs)
   - Enable all required language extensions (src/Demo/Loader.hs)

 - Add content-addressed tmux sessions:
   - Session names derived from file content hash (app/Demo.hs)
   - 'fin' subcommand to terminate sessions (app/Demo.hs)
   - 'attach' subcommand for reconnection (app/Demo.hs)
   - Session clash detection with helpful messages (app/Demo.hs)

 - Update README with installation instructions (README.md)
