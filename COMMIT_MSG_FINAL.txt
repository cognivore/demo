Problem: Missing E2E tests and self-referential example

Solution:

 - Add comprehensive E2E test suite (test/E2E/FullFeatureSpec.hs):
   - DSL feature tests verifying presentation construction
   - Zipper navigation tests with bounds checking
   - Variable substitution end-to-end tests
   - System command streaming tests
   - IPC integration tests for slide changes
   - Full workflow test demonstrating variable passing
 - Create self-referential presentation (examples/DemoPresentation.hs):
   - 18 slides presenting the Demo framework
   - Showcases all DSL combinators
   - Live demos of building and testing
   - Code elaborations of key abstractions
   - System commands with real streaming output
 - 62 total tests, 60 passing, 2 pending (GHCI sandbox limitations)
